    # is stuck in the transition to another repository and was **NOT** ported).
    #
    # Has known issue where it can not be ran as a container due to some fucked
    # up seccomp Ubuntu FUCKERY. And what's bad is that barely any diagnosis
    # exists and it boils down to "oops you'll have to seccomp=unconfined
    # because even we don't really know what fails". The bug itself is probably
    # completely normal, let's face it software has bugs.
    #
    #   <https://github.com/docker-library/python/issues/835>
    #
    # Basically we get Python complaining it can not create threads.
    # Incidentally, something similarly fishy happens to the postgres image.
    #
    # And FUCK YOU why is the HOST of all systems suddenly implicitly
    # responsible for this? Like what did we do containers for? We're now at a
    # state where we need to ship the hosts CONTROL PLANE for reasons, so it
    # did not actually fix anything. We only complicate running software since
    # this file itself is far too long and required far too many tries.
    #
    # And Podman does not support seccomp=unconfined:

    # At least they document their shit
